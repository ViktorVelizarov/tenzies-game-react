# Tenzis Game

This is a classic game I recreated using React. The purpose of the game is to get the same number on all 10 dice. You can roll the dice using the ROLL button and hold their value by clicking each individual dice. When all the dice get the same number the game is over and you can start a new game by clicking the button PLAY AGAIN.

this is how the game starts

This is how it looks when you "hold" dice
